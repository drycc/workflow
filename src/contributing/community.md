# Community

Drycc software is fully open source. As such, the "Drycc community" consists of anyone who uses the Drycc software and participates in its evolution, whether by answering questions, finding bugs, suggesting enhancements, or writing documentation or code.

Drycc development is coordinated through numerous project repositories [on GitHub][github]. Anyone can check out the source code for any Drycc component, fork it, make improvements, and create a pull request to offer those changes back to the Drycc community.

[Engine Yard][ey] maintains the numerous Drycc projects, and as such, decides what ends up in the official GitHub repositories. Drycc depends on the contributions of the community; the maintainers will not ignore pull requests or issues.

Drycc uses the timeless, highly efficient, and totally unfair system known as "Benevolent Dictator for Life" ([BDFL][]). [Gabriel Monroy][gabriel], the creator of Drycc, is our BDFL and has final say over all decisions related to Drycc.

## Open Source Bounties

Drycc projects are bounty-friendly.  We believe open source bounty sites can be constructive tools in the development of open source software. Community members are encouraged to a) offer bounties and b) receive bounties for open source contributions that benefit everyone. The Drycc maintainers, however, will not accept bounties on this project but are more than happy to help community members attempting bounties.
