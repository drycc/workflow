# Conduct

The Drycc community welcomes and encourages participation by **everyone**.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.

The Drycc developer community continues to grow, and it is inevitable that disagreements and conflict will arise. We ask that participants conduct themselves according to these principles:

1. **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**

2. **Be considerate.**

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

3. **Be respectful.**

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and bad manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

4. **Be careful in the words that you choose.**

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are never appropriate for the community.
