# Welcome to Drycc

Drycc is a community branch of the popular PaaS service deis. 

Since Microsoft acquired the Deis team, it has stopped updating, so it decided to work hard to
build a completely new and open developer community, we invite everyone to join us and help build
the next generation of PaaS cloud services.

Drycc Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer
to any Kubernetes cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications.

Drycc Workflow includes capabilities for building and deploying from source via `git push`, simple
application configuration, creating and rolling back releases, managing domain names and SSL
certificates, providing seamless edge routing, aggregating logs, and sharing applications with
teams. All of this is exposed through a simple REST API and command line interface.
