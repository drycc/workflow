# Welcome to Drycc

Drycc Workflow is an open source container cloud platform.

Usually we also call it Container as a Service(CaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer
to any Kubernetes cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications.

Drycc Workflow includes capabilities for building and deploying from source via `git push`, simple
application configuration, creating and rolling back releases, managing domain names and SSL
certificates, providing seamless edge routing, aggregating logs, and sharing applications with
teams. All of this is exposed through a simple REST API and command line interface.
