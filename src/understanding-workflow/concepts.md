# Concepts

Drycc Workflow is a lightweight application platform that deploys and scales
Twelve-Factor apps as containers across a Kubernetes cluster.

## Twelve-Factor Applications

The [Twelve-Factor App][] is a methodology for building modern
applications that can be scaled across a distributed system.

Twelve-factor is a valuable synthesis of years of experience with
software-as-a-service apps in the wild, particularly on the
Heroku platform.

Workflow is designed to run applications that adhere to the [Twelve-Factor App][]
methodology and best practices.

## Kubernetes

[Kubernetes][] is an open-source cluster manager developed by Google and
donated to the [Cloud Native Compute Foundation][cncf]. Kubernetes manages all
the activity on your cluster, including: desired state convergence, stable
service addresses, health monitoring, service discovery, and DNS resolution.

Workflow builds upon Kubernetes abstractions like Services,
Deployments and Pods to provide a developer-friendly experience.
Building containers directly from application source code, aggregating logs,
and managing deployment configurations and app releases are just some of the
features Workflow adds.

Drycc Workflow is a set of Kubernetes-native components, installable via
[Helm][]. Systems engineers who are familiar with Kubernetes will feel right
at home running Workflow.

See the [components][components] overview for more detail.

## Docker

[Docker][] is an open source project to build, ship and run any
application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container.

If you have not yet converted your application to containers, Workflow provides
a simple and straightforward "source to Docker image" capability. Supporting
multiple language runtimes via community [buildpacks][], building your application
in a container can be as easy as `git push drycc master`.

Applications which use either a Dockerfile or reference external Docker
images are launched unmodified.

## Applications

Workflow is designed around the concept of an [application][], or app.

Applications come in one of three forms:

1. a collection of source files stored in a `git` repository
2. a Dockerfile and associated source files stored in a `git` repository
3. a reference to an existing image at a Docker repository

Applications are identified by a unique name for easy reference. If you do not
specify a name when creating your application, Workflow generates one for you.
Workflow also manages related information, including domain names, SSL
certificates, and developer-provided configuration.

## Build, Release, Run

### Build Stage

The [builder][] component processes incoming `git push drycc master` requests
and manages your application packaging.

If your application is using a [buildpack][buildpacks], builder will launch an ephemeral
job to extract and execute the packaging instructions. The resulting
application artifact is stored by the platform for execution during the run
stage.

If instead builder finds a [Dockerfile][dockerfile], it follows those instructions to
create a Docker image. The resulting artifact is stored in a Drycc-managed registry which
will be referenced during the run stage.

If another system already builds and packages your application, that container
artifact can be used directly. When referencing an [external Docker
image][dockerimage], the builder component doesn't attempt to repackage your
app.

### Release Stage

During the release stage, a [build][] is combined with [application configuration][config]
to create a new, numbered [release][]. New releases are created any time a new
build is created or application configuration is changed. Tracking releases as a
"write-only ledger" this way makes it easy to rollback to any previous release.

### Run Stage

The run stage deploys the new release to the underlying Kubernetes cluster by
changing the Deployment object which references the new release.
By managing the desired replica count, Workflow
orchestrates a zero-downtime, rolling update of your application. Once
successfully updated, Workflow removes the last reference to the old release.
Note that during the deploy, your application will be running in a mixed mode.

## Backing Services

Workflow treats all persistent services such as databases, caches, storage,
messaging systems, and other [backing services][] as resources managed
separately from your application. This philosophy aligns with Twelve-Factor
best practices.

Applications attach to backing services using [environment variables][].
Because apps are decoupled from backing services, they are free to
scale up independently, to use services provided by other apps, or to switch
to external or third-party vendor services.
